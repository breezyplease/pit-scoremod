# Static Scoremod
##Concept by Newteee, Developed by Breezy  
### An intuitive scoring system that applies static multipliers to temporary health (x1) and permanent health (x1.5 default)
Takes into account permanent health, temporary health, pill consumption and incaps suffered
> ####Health Bonus pool =   
+Permanent health * 1.5 (configurable multiplier)  
+Temporary health * 1 (unit multiplier)   
 * held temporary health
 * bonus pool for avoiding incaps: 4 survivors * 2 max incaps * 30 temp hp/incap = 240   
 -50 point penalty for each consumption of a pill from the starting set
 * bonus pool for preserving pills from the starting set:  4 survivors * 50 temp hp/pill = 200  
 -30 point penalty for every incap;
